### HARDWARE WALLET SETUP

```
While modern computers and smartphones are capable of running the cryptographic algorithms
required to use Bitcoin, they are inherently insecure.
These devices perform multiple tasks, such as taking photos or browsing. Generally, the more
a device can do, the greater security vulnerabilities it may have.
HARDWARE WALLET
A hardware wallet is an electronic device that can perform a limited number
of tasks: creating a password, calculating a Bitcoin address, or authenti-
cating a transaction. The risk of succumbing to a hack attempt is mitigated
by reducing the functionality of the device.
ADDITIONAL DISPLAY
Hardware wallet devices are designed with a built-in display. Validation
on this additional display prevents unauthorized access and boosts security.
```
```
PRIVATE KEYS
To keep your coins secure, a hardware wallet isolates your private key in offline encrypted memory,
and will never send your private keys to the computer it is connected to.
In alphabetic order: Bitbox, Blockstream, ColdCard, Foundation, Ledger, and Trezor are the leading
hardware wallet brands.

### HARDWARE WALLET SETUP PREPARATION

Prepare to set up your hardware wallet – it shouldn’t take longer than 30 minutes.

Prepare your computer, a piece of paper and something to write with. Make sure you have internet
access and a moment of peace and quiet.

Make sure no one interrupts or observes you during this procedure – this will ensure the process
is conducted safely and efficiently.

**Most of the operations in this guide involve sensitive data – we recommend conducting them
in a private location.**

Remember, your hardware wallet can be easily reset to factory settings and you won’t lose your
coins as long as you still have the seed phrase for recovery. You can repeat this step several times
if you feel the need to practice.

Setting up Your Hardware Wallet
```
This process usually begins with installing software on your computer that allows convenient use
of the hardware wallet.

```
Carefully follow the instructions shown on your computer screen and the display on the device. Add
additional security measures (usually a PIN code) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Next, write down the words displayed on the hardware wallet screen - this is your secret recovery
seed phrase.
```
```
Secure Your Recovery Seed Phrase
```
```
The seed phrase is extremely important and indispensable for retrieving assets in case
the hardware wallet is lost, damaged, or destroyed. It should be stored in a safe location.
```
```
Transferring Assets to Your Hardware Wallet
```
```
After a proper wallet setup, you can transfer bitcoin assets to it from another wallet or from
an exchange.
```
```
We recommend reading the instruction manual supplied by the manufacturer, since the process
may differ depending on the wallet model.

### HARDWARE WALLET SETUP

```
Hardware wallets are designed in such a way that only their owner can access the private key – this
boosts security.
The recovery seed phrase is usually a sequence of 12 or 24 words that encode the private key
to your wallet. Remember, these words allow access to your assets!
```
```
A seed phrase can be transferred between hardware wallets made by different
manufacturers. The recovery seed phrase is more important than the device that
holds it.
Lost your hardware wallet? Or has it stopped working? Or perhaps you’d like
to replace it with another model? No problem! Just enter your recovery seed
phrase into the new wallet to regain access to your assets.
```
```
Protect your seed phrase – it’s the only method to regain access to your assets in case you lose
your hardware wallet.
Without your seed phrase, you irreversibly lose access to your cryptocurrency holdings and the
ability to manage them.
```
```
WARNING!
NEVER CREATE A DIGITAL COPY (PHOTO, TEXT MESSAGE, EMAIL) OF YOUR RECOVERY SEED. ALSO, NEVER
READ YOUR SEED PHRASE OUT LOUD AND AVOID TYPING IT ON A COMPUTER CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET!
