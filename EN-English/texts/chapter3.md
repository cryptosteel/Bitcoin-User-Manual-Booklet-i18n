### BACKUP MANAGEMENT

**Why do I need a recovery seed backup?**

You’re the only person who has access to your seed phrase, so make sure to create a backup. Backup management is simple and secure as long as it stays offline.

Electronic devices seldom survive for longer than 10 or 20 years: they’re not a good solution for long-term asset storage.

A recovery seed phrase backup provides effective protection in case of errors related to software and firmware updates.

Retrieving a backup-up recovery seed phrase takes just a few minutes.

Make sure your seed phrase backup is never posted, uploaded, attached or sent online. Don’t take pictures of your passwords and don’t store them in the form of digital content.

## BACKUP MANAGEMENT

### You need a safe backup for restoring access if you damage or lose your wallet

***

### BACKUP MANAGEMENT - PREPARATION

Your Hardware Wallet generates an offline seed phrase - it is never uploaded to the Internet from your hardware wallet, as this type of device is always offline. This makes it much safer than a mobile phone or a computer app.

**Never take pictures of your seed phrase!**

**Remember, photos can be seen or accessed – even without your knowledge!**

No-one other than you should access that seed phrase - the moment the device is initiated, it’s stored in the hardware wallet’s encrypted memory. You should already have an initial paper backup copy. 

**Protect your seed phrase – create a permanent, metal backup.**

Creating a metal backup will take about 30 minutes.

This will protect your seed phrase from hazards like water, fire, electrical shocks, or and physical degradation over time.

Buy a ready-made backup tool or check online tutorials for DIY solutions.

You can also use tutorials available on youtube.com/@Cryptosteel.

## BACKUP MANAGEMENT - METAL BACKUP

Creating a metal backup of your seed phrase ensures durability and higher resistance to damage compared to other storage methods.

Metal backups are highly resistant to electric shock, fire, water, and physical degradation over time.

**A METAL BACKUP IS THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT YOUR SEED PHRASE IN CASE OF UNFORESEEN SITUATIONS.**

Cryptosteel is a patented, easy to use, and extremely durable device.

Manually stamping a password onto a metal plate using dots is an alternative solution. It has also been widely tested, although it’s much more time consuming. After deciphering, the dots represent private keys or a recovery seed phrase.

If you prefer budget, DIY solutions, you can buy a set of engraving tools, a metal plate, and etch your seed phrase onto it. Nevertheless, this solution may be less safe due to low-quality materials and illegibility.

## BACKUP MANAGEMENT - TEST YOUR BACKUP

Make sure your seed phrase backup works before it’s ever needed: in days, months, or years.

**TEST YOUR BACKUP IMMEDIATELY INSTEAD OF ASSUMING IT’S CORRECT**

To finalize the backup procedure, make sure the seed won’t fail you when you most need it.

### THE TEST

- Transfer a small amount to your new seed phrase
- Reset the device
- Conduct the recovery process

The test is successful if you can access your assets after conducting the recovery process. Congratulations! Your backup is properly configured and will allow you to recover access to your assets in the future, any time you need it.

**ATTENTION!**

**ONLY A TESTED BACKUP WILL ENSURE FUTURE ACCESS TO YOUR ASSETS. WALLET RECOVERY IS IMPOSSIBLE IF THE SEED PHRASE IS INCORRECT.**
