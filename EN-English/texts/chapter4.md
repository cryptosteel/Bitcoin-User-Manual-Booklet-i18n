## THE LIGHTNING NETWORK

**The Lightning Network** is the second layer of the Bitcoin network. The Lightning Networks work by locking money on the Bitcoin blockchain and issuing a corresponding amount on Lightning. This allows for Bitcoin transactions essentially at the speed of your internet connection.

**The Lightning Network** establishes direct payment channels between users, and thus enables near-real time transactions. There’s no need to confirm every transfer on the blockchain in the blockchain network. This translates into lower fees and immediate payments.

**The Lightning Network** is an independent network that facilitates using Bitcoin in everyday life, thanks to fast and low-cost transactions across a growing number of apps.

**The Lightning Network** has been integrated into a multitude of apps. Their assortment is wide and dynamically evolving, varying according to needs, preferences, and new developments in technology.

### THE LIGHTNING NETWORK - INSTALL APP

To help you experience the benefits and explore the possibilities of the Lightning Network, we’ve selected hot wallet apps (connected to the internet) that can be installed on your smartphone. Cryptosteel recommends two options: Wallet of Satoshi (for beginners) and Breez (some technical knowledge required).

- If you’re planning to make your first Lightning Network transactions, Wallet of Satoshi is the better choice. It’s a custodial wallet offering ease of use; as such, it’s recommended for beginner users. The app is ready immediately after installation. Wallet of Satoshi can be downloaded from walletofsatoshi.com.
- Nonetheless, you should aim to adopt a fully self-custodial wallet like Breez. In this case, you are charged for opening the Lightning channels, and by owning your own channel, you have greater control over your assets. If you choose the Breez app, you will be charged a small fee (usually less than $1) for opening your channel. Breez can be downloaded from breez.technology.

**Remember, both the Wallet of Satoshi and Breez are good and tested options for the Lightning Network.**

## THE LIGHTNING NETWORK - FUELLING

It’s recommended that beginner users operate with a smaller amount in order to get familiar with the functioning of the Lightning Network and conduct their first transaction. This will take about 20 minutes of your time.

- Generate your receiving address:
	- by clicking the “Receive” button and choosing the option “Bitcoin On-Chain” in Wallet of Satoshi
	- or “Receive via BTC Address” in Breez.
- Copy the address to your computer
- Enter the received address to your hardware wallet
- Conduct a small transaction and wait for it to be confirmed on the blockchain. Depending on the fees you choose to pay, this could take up to or over an hour.
- Your assets will fuel the Lightning app account, and now you will be able to conduct instant transitions

The precise steps required to deposit on a Lightning wallet may vary depending on the chosen app. The efficacy of the Lightning Network is based on the fundamental principle of full backing in Bitcoin assets. By depositing your assets in the Lightning Network, your Bitcoin becomes a Lightning Network deposit. Withdrawing funds from the Lightning Network dispatches a respective reserve in the Bitcoin network. All costs related to the Lightning Network are presented before confirming a transaction.

**ATTENTION!**

**REGULAR WITHDRAWALS FROM THE LIGHTNING NETWORK ARE RECOMMENDED AS THE BITCOIN NETWORK IS SAFER AND BETTER SUITED FOR LONG TERM STORAGE.**
