## How can I get bitcoin?

There are many ways to acquire Bitcoin. The most popular method is via purchase on cryptocurrency exchanges, where you can trade traditional currencies (like dollars, Euros, Yen) for Bitcoin.

You can also accept payment for goods or services in Bitcoin.

Consider asking your employer about paying your salary, or part of it, in bitcoin.

Remember, even though exchanges are a popular and easy way to acquire Bitcoin, they’re not recommended for long-term storage due to many risks. Assets stored on an exchange aren’t fully yours, since you don’t control the private keys to your wallet. Hence goes the saying:

**“NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR BITCOIN”**

In legal terms, you are not the owner of assets deposited on an exchange, you are only entitled to make a claim for their withdrawal.

Ensure the safety of your Bitcoin by using your own hardware wallet for storage.

### Trade or Earn

Wages vary, but we all earn money by working, and our work is measured in hours. If time is money, here are some suggestions for you depending on how much of your time/money you invest in Bitcoin. These will help you figure out how playful you can be and when it’s time to upgrade to something more serious:

- **one hour’s worth of work:**
experiment with transactions, test various online apps,

- **a day’s work:**
decide which free app to install on your smartphone,

- **two weeks:**
decide which hardware wallet to buy,

- **one month:**
acquire a metal backup to create a permanent backup for your recovery seed phrase. You can then recover your assets in case you lost your hardware wallet.

Bitcoin, like any traditional currency, is divided into subunits. Each bitcoin is a whopping one hundred million Satoshis (100,000,000 SATS). This makes it possible to buy bitcoin with a fraction of a cent.
